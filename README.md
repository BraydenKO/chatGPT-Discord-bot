# chatGPT-Discord-bot

## Note:

Requires that you create a discord bot using (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Get your bot's **token** and add it to the bots.env in the same folder as chatGPTbot.py under the key "chatGPT_TOKEN"

Get your **OpenAI API key** and add it to bots.env under the key "OPENAI_API_KEY"

As of now (12/25/2022) using chatGPT is free, but when you use the API like this, it costs a minimal amount per chat.
So, you need to set up billing information on OpenAI if you haven't already.

Your bot needs to connect to your billable OpenAI account, this is why you need to set these aspects up.
